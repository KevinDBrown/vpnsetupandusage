# üìò VPN Setup & Usage

This project demonstrates how to set up and validate a VPN connection using **ProtonVPN**, along with securely routing traffic from a **virtual machine (VM)** in Microsoft Azure. This hands-on walkthrough is ideal for aspiring IT professionals and cybersecurity learners building foundational network and cloud security knowledge.

### 2. Connect to a VPN Server
- Choose a server (e.g., `RO-FREE#5` for Romania) and connect using the WireGuard protocol.
- Monitor status and traffic logs.

## üåê IP Address Validation

### 3. Check IP Without VPN
- Before connecting to VPN, visit [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).
- Confirm your public IP and location.

### 4. Check IP With VPN
- After connecting to ProtonVPN, visit the site again.
- Confirm that your public IP and location now reflect the VPN tunnel.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è VPN Integration with Azure Virtual Machine

### 5. Deploy VM in Azure
- Use Azure Portal to create a Windows 11 VM.
- Configure networking, region, authentication, and security groups.

### 6. Run ProtonVPN from the VM
- Connect to the VM using Remote Desktop.
- Install and launch ProtonVPN inside the VM.
- Verify VPN tunneling by checking the public IP.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| **Images not displaying in README** | Ensure filenames and paths are case-sensitive and correctly referenced. Use raw URLs if needed. |
| **VPN not connecting** | Try switching from WireGuard to OpenVPN or connecting to another free server. Restart the client. |
| **No IP change detected** | Make sure the VPN is active and that DNS leaks are not occurring (test with [dnsleaktest.com](https://dnsleaktest.com)). |
| **Azure VM can‚Äôt browse with VPN** | Ensure outbound internet is enabled via NSG (Network Security Group) rules, and that ProtonVPN is installed within the VM, not just the host. |
| **Remote Desktop not connecting** | Verify that the correct port (TCP 3389) is open in your Azure VM's firewall and NSG settings. |

## ‚úÖ Summary

This project showcases how to implement, validate, and troubleshoot VPN usage both locally and in a cloud-based virtual machine. It reflects critical skills for IT support, system administration, and cybersecurity fundamentals.
